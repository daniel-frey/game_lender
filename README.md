#Game Lender

#### What is it?
Game lender is an application designed to allow users to maintain a video game library of their own, search for reviews, and
find others near them that have games that they would like to try out. 

Create an account, load it up with your own games, or search the database! You'll get results that can be filtered by type, 
genre, rating, etc. Plus you'll find embedded video reviews as well.

Find others in your area that might be willing to let you borrow a game you'd like to try, and connect with them.
